Replace the YourXYZ settings in the Brightcove.Settings file.   

Process will loop through 20 requests per minute for 5 minutes, then wait and send the next 100 55 minutes later.   

Records with errors will be dropped to a log file on your C drive.   You can edit the fetch code to return just these record ids (manually change it) if you want to rerun them later.

If you have questions or concerns you can reach me at twalston@southwestern.com and I will be happy to try to help. 

I am offering this up to the community because it took me a while to pull together all the pieces I needed to run the batch transcode.
